'''
Write a function def np_elementwise(mat1, mat2): that performs
element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
You can assume that mat1 and mat2 can be interpreted as numpy.ndarrays
You should return a tuple containing the element-wise sum, difference,
product, and quotient, respectively
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
You can assume that mat1 and mat2 are never empty
