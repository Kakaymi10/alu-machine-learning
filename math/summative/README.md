# Optimization with Multiple Variables

**Description:**
This repository contains the solution for the Optimization with Multiple Variables assignment. The assignment involved optimizing a linear regression model using gradient descent and comparing it with decision trees and random forests models to predict TV sales. Additionally, an API using FastAPI was created to provide predictions based on input values.

**Repository Contents:**
1. `linear_regression_optimization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the solution to the assignment.
2. `fastapi_app.py`: Python script implementing the FastAPI application for serving predictions.
3. `requirements.txt`: File listing the dependencies required to run the FastAPI application.
4. `demo_video.mp4`: Video demonstration of the mobile app predicting TV sales.
