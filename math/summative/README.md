# Optimization with Multiple Variables

**Description:**
This repository contains the solution for the Optimization with Multiple Variables assignment. The assignment involved optimizing a linear regression model using gradient descent and comparing it with decision trees and random forests models to predict TV sales. Additionally, an API using FastAPI was created to provide predictions based on input values.

**Repository Contents:**
1. `linear_regression_optimization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the solution to the assignment.
2. `fastapi_app`: Python script implementing the FastAPI application for serving predictions.
3. `demo_video.mp4`: Video demonstration of the mobile app predicting TV sales.


**API Endpoint:**
## FastAPI Endpoint:
The FastAPI application provides an endpoint for predictions. It can be accessed on [Swagger](https://sales-predictor.onrender.com/docs#/) or link for Postma ```https://sales-predictor.onrender.com/predict```

## Example Input and Output:
As an example, the following input-output pairs can be used:

1. **Input: 100, Output: 11.742328784271134**
2. **Input: 234, Output: 17.95979731110501**
