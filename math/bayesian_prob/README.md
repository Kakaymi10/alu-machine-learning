# Bayesian Probability

## Overview
This project explores Bayesian Probability, a statistical concept essential for reasoning under uncertainty. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Bayesian principles, including Bayes' rule, base rates, and Bayesian statistics. Through this project, we delve into the fundamentals of Bayesian Probability, its applications, and its significance in various domains.
