# Classification

## Introduction

Welcome to the Classification Repository! This repository aims to provide a basic understanding of classification tasks in machine learning.

## What is Classification?

Classification is a type of machine learning task where the goal is to predict the category or class of an input data point based on its features. It is a supervised learning task where the algorithm learns from labeled data.

## How Does Classification Work?

In classification, the algorithm learns a mapping function from input features to categorical labels by analyzing the training data. Once trained, the algorithm can classify new data points into predefined categories.

## Key Concepts in Classification

Some key concepts in classification include:

- **Classes**: The different categories or labels that the algorithm predicts.
- **Features**: The input variables or attributes used to make predictions.
- **Decision Boundaries**: The boundaries that separate different classes in the feature space.
- **Class Probabilities**: The probability of each class given the input features.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

## Types of Classification Algorithms

There are various classification algorithms, including:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forests**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **Neural Networks**

Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand.
