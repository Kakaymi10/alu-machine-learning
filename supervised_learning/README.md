# Supervised Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the Supervised Learning Repository! This repository serves as a basic introduction to supervised learning.

## What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled data, which is data that has both input and output parameters. The algorithm uses this labeled data to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.

## How Does Supervised Learning Work?

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset consisting of input-output pairs. During training, the algorithm learns the relationship between the input and output by adjusting its parameters iteratively. Once trained, the algorithm can make predictions or decisions when given new input data.

## Types of Supervised Learning

There are two main types of supervised learning:

1. **Classification**: In classification, the algorithm learns to predict a categorical label or class for a given input. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam, or identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

2. **Regression**: In regression, the algorithm learns to predict a continuous numerical value for a given input. For example, predicting house prices based on features such as size, location, and number of bedrooms.

## Key Concepts

Some key concepts in supervised learning include:

- **Training Data**: The labeled data used to train the algorithm.
- **Features**: The input variables or attributes used to make predictions.
- **Labels**: The output variable that the algorithm predicts.
- **Model**: The learned mapping function from input to output.
- **Loss Function**: A function that measures how well the model is performing.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error.
