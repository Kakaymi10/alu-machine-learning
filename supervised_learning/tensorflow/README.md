## Introduction to TensorFlow using TensorFlow 1.12

Welcome to the TensorFlow project! This guide serves as an introduction to TensorFlow version 1.12, covering the basics and core concepts needed to understand and utilize TensorFlow for building and training machine learning models.

### Resources

#### Read or Watch

- Low Level Intro (Excluding Datasets and Feature columns)
- Graphs
- Tensors
- Variables
- Placeholders
- Save and Restore (Up to Save and restore models, excluded)
- TensorFlow, why there are 3 files after saving the model?
- Exporting and Importing a MetaGraph
- TensorFlow - import meta graph and use variables from it

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- What is TensorFlow?
- What is a session? What is a graph?
- What are tensors?
- What are variables, constants, and placeholders? How do you use them?
- What are operations? How do you use them?
- What are namespaces? How do you use them?
- How to train a neural network in TensorFlow
- What is a checkpoint?
- How to save/load a model with TensorFlow
- What is the graph collection?
- How to add and get variables from the collection
