## Training Details

### Hyperparameters:
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001
- **Exploration Rate**: Decays over time from 0.666 to 0.657
- **Total Episodes**: 3,900+
- **Training Time**: 280 minutes
- **Loss**: Average loss over episodes, fluctuates during training
- **Updates**: 8,765 updates during training
- **FPS**: 128
- **Total Timesteps**: 36,064 timesteps

### Training Logs Summary:
The model was trained with the following performance metrics over multiple rollouts and training updates:

| Metric               | Value     |
|----------------------|-----------|
| **Episodes**         | 3,900     |
| **Total Timesteps**  | 36,064    |
| **Average Episode Length** | 289 steps |
| **Average Episode Reward** | 3.31   |
| **Exploration Rate** | 0.657     |
| **Loss** (last recorded)  | 0.021    |
| **Learning Rate**    | 0.0001    |
| **Training Time**    | 280 mins  |
| **Updates**          | 8,765     |

### Training Process:
- The agentâ€™s exploration rate gradually decayed over time from an initial rate of 0.666 to 0.657.
- The learning rate remained constant throughout training at 0.0001.
- The loss experienced slight fluctuations, with the final recorded value at 0.021.

## Usage

To use the trained model in your own environment:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Load the trained model:
    ```python
    from stable_baselines3 import [Algorithm]
    model = [Algorithm].load("path_to_model")
    ```

4. Use the model to make predictions or continue training:
    ```python
    # For prediction
    obs = env.reset()
    action, _states = model.predict(obs)
    
    # For continued training
    model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
    ```
